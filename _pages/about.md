From tinkering with gadgets as a kid to leading engineering clubs and competing in robotics challenges, my journey has always been about **building and learning**.  

- 🎓 Currently: **Freshman, UC San Diego – Aerospace Engineering (GPA 3.6)**  
- 🏫 Previously: **Christian Alliance International School (GPA 3.75)**  
- 🤝 Passionate about **collaboration and hands-on problem solving**  

I founded and led my high school’s **Mechanical Engineering Club**, growing it to 30+ members. At UCSD, I’m part of **Triton Unmanned Aerial Systems**, contributing to UAV design, flight software, and mission-critical hardware.  

💡 I believe innovation comes from **teamwork and curiosity**, and I’m excited to keep exploring the intersection of **mechanical, electrical, and software engineering**.
