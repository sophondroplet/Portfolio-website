Hello ‚Äî I'm Lek. I design, build, and iterate on mechatronic systems that bridge mechanical design, embedded firmware, control systems, and real-time software. My work sits at the intersection of hardware and software: from autonomous UAV subsystems to mechatronic prototypes and custom motor controllers.

## Quick snapshot:

- üéì Currently: Freshman, UC San Diego ‚Äî Aerospace Engineering
- üè´ Previously: Christian Alliance International School (founded the Mechanical Engineering Club)
- üî≠ Interests: UAV systems, control & embedded firmware, CAD & prototyping, and systems-level integration

## Why I build

I've always learned best by making. Early curiosity about how things move led me to lead teams, mentor younger students, and deliver projects that were used in competitions and school showcases. I enjoy projects where mechanical design, sensing, and low-level control come together to solve a real problem.

## Selected highlights

- **Founder & President** ‚Äî Mechanical Engineering Club (MEC): grew a small club into a 20+ member engineering group with funded projects, workshops, and school-wide exhibitions. See club projects and events on the MEC page.

- **Team Member** ‚Äî Triton Unmanned Aerial Systems (UCSD): contributed to UAV subsystems including antenna tracking, avionics integration, and mission preparations for the SUAS competition (Top ~25% worldwide).

- **Greendeck VR Competition** ‚Äî Champion: led a small team building a 3D interactive model using Unity and SketchUp.

## Representative projects (short)

- **Antenna tracker** ‚Äî a dual-axis, GPS-aware tracker that keeps a high-gain Yagi pointed at a moving aircraft. Highlights: ESP32 firmware (UDP telemetry), magnetometer calibration (ellipsoid fit), Onshape CAD, PID control and modified servos.

- **Camera gimbal** ‚Äî 2-axis stabilization with IMU sensing and custom ESC/FOC motor control. Demonstrates CAD, motor control (FOC), and embedded systems.

- **Other projects:** Ball-balancing robot, CNC pen plotter, and robot turret ‚Äî diverse maker projects combining CV, control loops, GRBL/Arduino, and desktop fabrication. Check the Projects index for details.

## Learnings & skills

- Mechanical: Onshape CAD, Fusion 360 CAD, FDM 3D printing, Resin 3D printing, Power tools, structural prototyping, mechanical bearings and mounts, Laser cutting
- Embedded & firmware: ESP32/Arduino, STM32, sensor interfacing (I2C, UART), PID tuning, PCB design on Altium, real-time control loops
- Control & algorithms: PID control, sensor calibration (magnetometer ellipsoid fit), coordinate transforms (ECEF), sensor fusion concepts
- Software & tooling: Python (calibration scripts, data processing), MAtlab, Git & GitHub (project documentation), Unity (VR prototype)

## How I work

- **Team-first:** I prioritize collaboration and clear communication when integrating multi-disciplinary systems.
- **Iterative & test-driven:** prototype early, validate in software-in-the-loop, then iterate hardware and firmware together.
- **Documentation-minded:** I keep project documentation and demos public when possible (links in each project page).
